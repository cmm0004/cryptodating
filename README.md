## Features to add

- [] 1/8inch standard bleed for easier printing.
- [] Option to arrange on letter-sized pre-perforated business card paper.
- [] Option to add a zero to even out puzzle, ie: when the puzzle looks best as a 3x3 block of symbols and this:

![15](public/imgs/pdfimgs/15.jpg) ![16](/public/imgs/pdfimgs/16.jpg)

doesn't look as good as:

![0](public/imgs/pdfimgs/0.jpg) ![15](public/imgs/pdfimgs/15.jpg) ![16](public/imgs/pdfimgs/16.jpg)

even though they both evaluate to 391, but I worry it would cause too much confusion.


## current bugs

- [] leading zeros a problem
- [] need to update key image to account for leading zeros, and possibly the 'aesthetic zeros' mentioned above.
